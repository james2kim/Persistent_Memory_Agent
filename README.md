## Memory Architecture

### Short-Term Memory (Redis)

Session-scoped memory with 24-hour TTL:

| Key Pattern                     | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `session:<id>`                  | Session state (messages, summary, taskState) |
| `checkpoint:<thread_id>:latest` | LangGraph checkpoint for workflow resumption |
| `user:<id>:active_session`      | Maps user to their active session            |
| `wfrun:<runId>`                 | Durable workflow run record (1-week TTL)     |
| `wfrun:<sessionId>:active`      | Currently active workflow run for session    |
| `wflock:<sessionId>`            | Session-scoped workflow mutex (120s TTL)     |

**Stale Session Archival**: When a session is inactive for 12+ hours but accessed again, the session summary is persisted to long-term memory before continuing. This ensures important context survives session expiration.

### Long-Term Memory (PostgreSQL + pgvector)

Permanent storage for extracted knowledge and documents:

**memories table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type` | fact, preference, goal, decision, summary |
| `content` | The extracted memory content |
| `confidence` | 0.0-1.0 extraction confidence |
| `embedding` | VoyageAI embedding (vector) for semantic search |
| `user_id` | Owner of the memory |

**documents table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `source` | File path or URL |
| `title` | Document title |
| `metadata` | JSON metadata |
| `user_id` | Owner |

**chunks table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `content` | Chunk text |
| `embedding` | vector for cosine similarity (HNSW indexed) |
| `search_vector` | tsvector for BM25 keyword search |
| `start_year` | Temporal range start (extracted) |
| `end_year` | Temporal range end (null = "Present") |
| `document_id` | Parent document |

**quizzes table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | Quiz title (from generation) |
| `quiz_data` | JSON: full quiz with questions, options, answers, explanations |
| `input_data` | JSON: extracted intent (topic, difficulty, types) |
| `question_count` | Number of questions |
| `user_id` | Owner |

**flashcards table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | Flashcard set title (from generation) |
| `flashcard_data` | JSON: full output with title, topicSummary, and cards array |
| `input_data` | JSON: extracted intent (topic, cardCount, difficulty) |
| `card_count` | Number of cards in the set |
| `user_id` | Owner |

## Workflow Nodes

### 1. retrievalGate

Routes queries based on query rewriting + rule-based classification + LLM fallback + deterministic policy.

**Query Rewriting** (pronoun/reference resolution):
Resolves "it", "this", "that" and implicit references before classification:

1. LLM (Haiku) extracts the most recent topic from conversation context
2. Programmatic regex substitution replaces references with the extracted topic
3. No full-query LLM rewriting — avoids hallucination in the rewrite step

```
"quiz me on it" + context about mitosis → "quiz me on mitosis"
"explain"       + context about React   → "explain React"
```

**Rule-Based Classification** (instant, free):
Handles 60-70% of queries without LLM calls:

- Greetings/thanks → `conversational`
- Personal statements ("I am/like/prefer...") → `personal`
- Personal questions ("my goal", "what did I say") → `personal`
- Topic questions ("explain X", "what is Y") → `study_content`
- Lifestyle advice ("should I nap?") → `off_topic`

**LLM Tool Selection** (Haiku with `bindTools` — autonomous tool routing):

When no rule-based classification matches, the LLM sees the registered tools via Anthropic's native `tool_use` API and autonomously decides whether to invoke one:

```typescript
const modelWithTools = haikuModel.bindTools(langchainTools);
// LLM sees: quiz_generation, flashcard_generation
// Decides: call a tool, or respond that no tool is needed
```

If the LLM calls a tool → route to workflow execution. If no tool is called → fall through to LLM classification.

**LLM Classification Fallback** (Haiku — for remaining ambiguous cases):

- `queryType`: personal | study_content | general_knowledge | conversational | off_topic | unclear | workflow
- `referencesPersonalContext`: boolean

**Policy** (deterministic):

- `conversational` or `off_topic` → skip all retrieval
- `study_content` → search documents + memories (for personalization)
- `personal` → search documents + memories with full budget
- `workflow` → retrieve documents + memories, route to `executeWorkflow`
- `unclear` → request clarification

### 2. retrieveMemoriesAndChunks

Executes hybrid search based on gate decision.

**Two-Tier Memory Retrieval:**
Profile memories (preferences, facts) are always relevant for personalization but don't match well via semantic similarity (e.g., "give me a code example" won't semantically match "prefers TypeScript"). Solution:

1. **Tier 1 - Profile memories**: Fetch preferences + facts by confidence (no embedding needed)
2. **Tier 2 - Contextual memories**: Similarity search for goals, decisions, summaries

| Budget  | Profile | Contextual | Total |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Full    | 3       | 2          | 5     |
| Minimal | 2       | 0          | 2     |

**Hybrid Document Search Pipeline:**

1. Extract temporal year from query (e.g., "what did I do in 2023" → 2023)
2. Run in parallel:
   - **Embedding search**: pgvector cosine similarity with optional temporal filter
   - **Keyword search**: PostgreSQL tsvector/BM25 with same temporal filter
3. **RRF Fusion**: Combine results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion
   - `score = Σ(1 / (k + rank))` where k=60
4. Deduplicate and return top K chunks

### 3. injectContext

Builds the context block and generates the response.

**U-Shape Distribution** (based on "Lost in the Middle" research):

- LLMs attend most to beginning and end of context
- Most relevant items placed at front and back
- Least relevant items buried in the middle

```
Input (by relevance):  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output (U-shape):      [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2]
```

**Context Format:**

```
## User Context
- [goal] Complete the study plan by Friday
- [preference] Prefers concise explanations

## Sources
[Source: Resume.pdf]
Software Engineer at Axiom, June 2022 – Present...

[Source: Biology Notes.md]
Cellular respiration is the process...
```

### 4. extractAndStoreKnowledge

Background extraction of knowledge from the conversation (runs async, doesn't block response).

**Knowledge Extraction:**

- Classifies input as `study_material`, `personal_memory`, or `ephemeral`
- Study material → ingested as document chunks with embeddings
- Personal memory → stored with type classification:
  - `preference`: User likes/prefers something (language, tools, learning style)
  - `fact`: Objective info (job, school, current projects)
  - `goal`: Future-oriented aspirations
  - `decision`: Past choices made
- Deduplicates against existing memories (cosine similarity ≥ 0.9)

**Message Summarization (Background):**
Prevents unbounded context growth while preserving important information.

| Trigger           | Action                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Messages reach 15 | Summarize oldest 10, keep newest 5 |
| Result            | Messages oscillate between 5-15    |

```
Before: [m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10, m11, m12, m13, m14, m15]
                    ↓ summarize oldest 10
After:  [summary] + [m11, m12, m13, m14, m15]
```

The summary is appended to the session's running summary, preserving context across pruning cycles.

### 5. executeWorkflow

Routes to and executes registered workflow tools (e.g., quiz generation).

**Tool Routing:**
The retrieval gate resolves the tool via LLM tool selection (`model.bindTools()` + Anthropic `tool_use`). The selected tool name is stored in agent state as `matchedWorkflowTool`. As a defense-in-depth fallback, `executeWorkflow` also has keyword-based scoring if the LLM selection didn't resolve a tool.

```typescript
// LLM-selected tool (preferred — autonomous selection)
const preResolved = state.matchedWorkflowTool ? getToolByName(state.matchedWorkflowTool) : null;
// Fallback: keyword scoring against registered tools
const routeResult = preResolved ? { tool: preResolved } : routeToTool(userQuery);
```

**Session Locking:**
Prevents concurrent workflow execution within a session. A Redis-backed mutex (`SET NX EX 120s`) ensures only one workflow runs per session at a time. If a lock is held, the request is rejected with "A workflow is already running."

**In-Workflow Retrieval:**
Workflow tools receive a `ctx.retrieve(query)` function that allows them to fetch additional document chunks mid-execution. This is used when the initial retrieval context is thin (< 500 characters) — the tool can enrich its context without restarting the pipeline.

**Durable Execution:**
See [Durable Workflow Execution](#13-durable-workflow-execution) below.

### 6. clarificationResponse

Handles ambiguous queries by asking for clarification.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. HNSW Vector Index

Similarity search on the `chunks.embedding` column uses an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index instead of sequential scan. HNSW builds a multi-layered graph over the vectors — top layers have sparse, long-range connections for coarse navigation, bottom layers have dense, short-range connections for precise lookup. Search traverses top-down in O(log n) hops rather than computing distance against every row (O(n)).

| Parameter         | Value                 | Effect                                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `m`               | 16                    | Max connections per node. Higher = better recall, more memory           |
| `ef_construction` | 64                    | Build-time candidate list. Higher = better graph quality, slower builds |
| `ef_search`       | 40 (pgvector default) | Query-time candidate list. Tunable per-query via `SET hnsw.ef_search`   |
| Operator class    | `vector_cosine_ops`   | Matches the `<=>` cosine distance operator used in queries              |

Tradeoff: ~99%+ recall vs exact search, which is negligible — chunking strategy and embedding quality are the actual retrieval bottlenecks.

### 2. Hybrid Search with Temporal Filtering

Pure semantic search misses queries like "what did I do in 2023" because embeddings don't capture temporal specificity well. The hybrid approach:

- **Embedding search**: Catches semantic meaning ("work experience" ≈ "job")
- **Keyword search**: Catches exact terms ("2023", "Axiom")
- **Temporal filter**: `start_year <= queryYear AND (end_year IS NULL OR end_year >= queryYear)`
- **RRF fusion**: Combines both rankings fairly

### 3. Three-Stage Routing (Rules → Tool Selection → LLM Classification)

Query routing uses a progressive pipeline that balances speed, cost, and accuracy:

1. **Rule-based filter** (~60-70%): Regex patterns handle greetings, personal statements, topic questions — instant, free
2. **LLM tool selection**: For unmatched queries, the LLM sees registered tools via `bindTools()` and autonomously decides whether to invoke one
3. **LLM classification fallback**: If no tool was selected, Haiku classifies the query type for retrieval routing

This ensures workflow tools are selected by the LLM (handling ambiguous phrasings), while obvious non-workflow queries bypass the LLM entirely.

### 4. Two-Tier Memory Retrieval

Pure semantic similarity fails for personalization queries:

- "Give me a code example" doesn't semantically match "prefers TypeScript"
- But the TypeScript preference is essential for good code generation

Solution: separate profile retrieval from contextual retrieval:

- **Profile memories** (preferences, facts): Always fetched by confidence, no embedding needed
- **Contextual memories** (goals, decisions): Fetched by semantic similarity

This ensures user preferences are always available for generation tasks without relying on embedding similarity.

### 5. Off-Topic Handling

Off-topic queries (stock tips, medical advice) skip retrieval entirely and get a clean redirect: "I'm a study assistant—happy to help with learning or organizing your notes."

No mention of "I didn't find relevant documents" because that's confusing for genuinely off-topic questions.

### 6. Session Summary Persistence

When a session goes stale (12+ hours inactive), the accumulated session summary is stored as a long-term memory. This captures:

- Decisions made during the session
- Goals established
- Important context

Even after the Redis session expires, this knowledge persists.

### 7. U-Shape Context Distribution

Based on "Lost in the Middle" research showing LLMs attend poorly to middle content:

- Most relevant → front (high attention)
- Second most relevant → back (high attention)
- Least relevant → middle (low attention)

### 8. Adaptive Model Selection

The response generation step dynamically chooses between Haiku (fast/cheap) and Sonnet (capable/expensive) based on retrieval confidence:

| Scenario                                     | Model  | Rationale                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| No context needed                            | Haiku  | Conversational queries don't need heavy reasoning           |
| Good retrieval (≥2 chunks, distance ≤0.6)    | Haiku  | Synthesizing from strong sources is straightforward         |
| Weak retrieval (few chunks or high distance) | Sonnet | Better at reasoning with sparse info, admitting uncertainty |

This reduces cost and latency for ~70% of queries while preserving quality for complex cases.

### 9. Document Title Citations

Sources cite document titles (e.g., `[Source: Resume.pdf]`) instead of opaque chunk indices, making responses more useful.

### 10. Production Resilience

Three layers protect against transient external API failures:

**Rate Limiting**: Express middleware limits each user to a fixed request rate on `/api/chat` and `/api/upload`, preventing abuse and runaway costs.

**Retry with Exponential Backoff**: All LLM (Anthropic) and embedding (VoyageAI) calls are wrapped in a generic `withRetry` utility. On transient failures (429, 5xx, network errors), requests retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff and jitter (~1s, ~2s, ~4s). Auth errors (401/403) and bad requests (400) fail immediately.

**Embedding Fallback**: If the embedding API fails even after retries, the retrieval pipeline degrades gracefully instead of returning empty results:

- Document search falls back to keyword-only (PostgreSQL full-text search)
- Profile memories (preferences, facts) are still retrieved (no embedding needed)
- Contextual memories (goals, decisions) are skipped since they require similarity search
- The `embeddingFallback` flag is captured in trace metadata for observability

### 11. LLM-Driven Tool Selection

Workflow tools are routed via Anthropic's native `tool_use` API. Each registered tool is converted to a LangChain `tool()` definition and bound to the model:

```typescript
const langchainTools = REGISTERED_TOOLS.map((wfTool) =>
  tool(async (input) => JSON.stringify(input), {
    name: wfTool.name,
    description: wfTool.description,
    schema: z.object({ topic: z.string() }),
  })
);
const modelWithTools = haikuModel.bindTools(langchainTools);
```

The LLM autonomously decides whether to invoke a tool based on the user's intent. This handles ambiguous phrasings ("help me study with some review cards") that regex patterns would miss, while the tool definitions constrain the LLM to only select from registered tools — no hallucinated tool names.

**Three-Stage Routing Pipeline:**
1. **Rule-based fast path** — Greetings, off-topic, personal, study content matched instantly (free, no LLM call)
2. **LLM tool selection** — For unmatched queries, the LLM sees tool descriptions and decides if one should be invoked
3. **LLM classification fallback** — If no tool was selected, classify the query type for retrieval routing

**Defense-in-Depth:** `executeWorkflow` retains a keyword-based fallback router as a safety net. If LLM tool selection fails or the tool name is lost during state propagation, keyword scoring resolves the tool from the query text.

### 12. Workflow Tool Abstraction

The workflow system uses a minimal interface that separates concerns:

```typescript
interface WorkflowTool {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  keywords: RegExp[];
  execute: (ctx: WorkflowContext, run: WorkflowRun) => Promise<WorkflowResult>;
}

interface WorkflowContext {
  userQuery: string;
  contextBlock: string | null;
  documents: RerankedChunk[];
  memories: Memory[];
  retrieve: (query: string) => Promise<DocumentChunk[]>;  // In-workflow retrieval
  // ...
}
```

Tools don't manage their own retrieval, routing, or persistence — they receive pre-fetched context and a durable run handle. This lets new tools be added by defining a name, description, and `execute` function, then registering in the tool registry. The LLM discovers tools automatically via `bindTools`. The `WorkflowRunner` handles token accumulation, error mapping, and observability for all tools uniformly.

### 13. Durable Workflow Execution

Workflows survive interruptions (server restarts, timeouts, client disconnects) via Redis-persisted step state:

```typescript
interface WorkflowRunRecord {
  runId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  toolName: string;
  status: 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  steps: Record<string, StepRecord>;  // Each step cached independently
}

interface StepRecord {
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  artifact: unknown | null;  // Cached result — skipped on resume
}
```

**Resumption logic:**
1. Step already completed → return cached artifact (skip re-execution)
2. Step marked running but stale (> 5 minutes) → re-execute (crash recovery)
3. Step marked running and fresh → reject (dual-execution prevention)
4. Step pending → execute normally

**Get-or-create with atomic Lua:** The `WorkflowRunStore` uses a Lua script to atomically check for an active run, supersede stale runs from different tools, or create a new run. This prevents race conditions between concurrent requests.

**Artifact validation:** Cached artifacts are optionally validated against Zod schemas on resume, catching cases where the schema evolved between the original execution and the resume.

Run records are stored with a 1-week TTL in Redis (`wfrun:{runId}`), with an active-run pointer (`wfrun:{sessionId}:active`) for fast lookup.

### 14. Workflow Error Mapping

Workflow tools use a catch-and-map pattern that separates internal errors from user-facing messages:

```typescript
const QUIZ_ERROR_MAP: ErrorMapping[] = [
  {
    code: 'INTENT_EXTRACTION_FAILED',
    message: "I couldn't understand what kind of quiz you'd like...",
    errorType: 'intent_extraction_failed',
    onError: (err) => validateObservation(err, failureSchema)  // Observability hook
  },
  {
    code: 'GENERATION_FAILED',
    message: "I had trouble generating the quiz...",
    errorType: 'generation_failed',
    onError: (err) => validateObservation(err, failureSchema)
  },
  {
    code: 'VALIDATION_FAILED',
    message: "The generated quiz didn't pass validation...",
    errorType: 'validation_failed',
    onError: (err) => validateObservation(err, failureSchema)
  },
]
```

Each step throws `WorkflowStepError` with a machine-readable code. The `WorkflowRunner.execute()` catches these and maps them to user-facing messages via the error table. Optional `onError` hooks validate failure observations against Zod schemas for eval integration.

### 15. Token Accounting

The `WorkflowRunner` auto-accumulates token usage across all steps:

```typescript
async runStep<T>(stepName, spanName, fn, opts?) {
  const result = await fn();
  // Auto-extract from step artifacts
  this.totalInputTokens += result.usage?.inputTokens ?? 0;
  this.totalOutputTokens += result.usage?.outputTokens ?? 0;
  return result;
}
```

`runner.success()` and `runner.failure()` attach the accumulated totals to the result, giving the trace layer a single place to read workflow-level token costs without each tool manually tracking usage.

### 16. Authentication with Clerk

Authentication is handled by Clerk, a managed auth service. This was chosen over building custom auth because:

- Not the focus of this project (learning agent architecture, not auth)
- Production-ready security out of the box
- Simple integration with React and Express

**Authentication Flow:**

1. User signs in via Clerk modal (supports email, OAuth providers)
2. Frontend passes JWT token with each API request via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
3. Backend verifies token via `requireAuth()` middleware from `@clerk/express`
4. `getOrCreateUser()` finds or creates a user record in PostgreSQL linked to the Clerk ID
5. All data (memories, documents, sessions) is scoped to the authenticated user

## Quiz Generation Workflow

The quiz tool is the first workflow tool and demonstrates all the patterns of the tool calling system. It runs a 5-step durable pipeline:

### Model Selection

| Step | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Intent extraction | Haiku | Fast structured output — extraction, not reasoning |
| Quiz generation | Sonnet | Complex reasoning for quality questions + consistency |

Both use `.withStructuredOutput(zodSchema, { includeRaw: true })` to get usage metadata alongside parsed output.

### Schemas

```typescript
// Input (extracted from user query)
quizInputSchema: {
  topic: string (2-200 chars),
  questionCount: int (1-20),
  questionTypes: ['multiple_choice' | 'true_false'],
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard',
  focusAreas?: string[] (max 5),
}

// Output (generated quiz)
quizOutputSchema: {
  title: string (5-200 chars),
  questions: [{
    type: 'multiple_choice' | 'true_false',
    question: string (10-500 chars),
    options: string[] (2-6 items),
    correctAnswer: string,
    explanation: string (10-500 chars),
  }] (1-20 items),
}
```

### True/False Normalization

LLMs produce inconsistent true/false answers ("true", "T", "correct", "Yes"). The `normalizeTrueFalse` function standardizes all variations to exactly `"True"` / `"False"` in both options and correctAnswer fields before validation runs. This is applied in-place after generation.

### Quiz Persistence

Quizzes are auto-saved when the `/api/chat` handler detects `workflowData` with a `title` and `questions` array in the response. The quiz ID is returned to the frontend for navigation.

```
/api/chat response → workflowData detected → QuizStore.save() → quizId in response
```

### Frontend Quiz Experience

The frontend provides an interactive quiz-taking UI:

- **QuizList**: Lists saved quizzes with title, question count, creation date, and delete with confirmation
- **QuizView**: Interactive quiz with option selection, submit scoring, correct/incorrect visual feedback, explanations, and retake

## Flashcard Generation Workflow

The flashcard tool is the second workflow tool, following the same durable execution patterns as the quiz tool. It generates study flashcards from uploaded documents.

### Schemas

```typescript
// Input (extracted from user query)
flashcardInputSchema: {
  topic: string (2-200 chars),
  cardCount: int (1-30),
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard',
  focusAreas?: string[] (max 5),
}

// Output (generated flashcard set)
flashcardOutputSchema: {
  title: string (5-200 chars),
  topicSummary: string (10-500 chars),
  cards: [{
    front: string (5-300 chars),   // question, term, or concept
    back: string (10-500 chars),   // answer, definition, or explanation
  }] (max 30 items),
}
```

### Card Variety

The generation prompt instructs the model to vary card types across definitions, concepts, comparisons, cause-and-effect, and application questions. Difficulty adjusts the complexity of both fronts and backs (easy: basic recall, medium: understanding, hard: application/synthesis).

### Topic Not Found

If the extracted topic isn't covered by the user's documents, the model returns `title: "TOPIC_NOT_FOUND"` with an empty cards array instead of hallucinating content. This is detected before persistence and returns a helpful message to the user.

### Frontend Flashcard Experience

- **FlashcardList**: Lists saved flashcard sets with title, card count, creation date, and delete with confirmation
- **FlashcardView**: Interactive card-by-card viewer with 3D flip animation (CSS `rotateY(180deg)` with `preserve-3d`), previous/next navigation, and card counter

## File Upload Pipeline

File upload has three constraints in production: Firebase's **32 MB request body limit**, Firebase's **60-second request timeout**, and Voyage AI's **rate limit** on embedding calls. The upload pipeline addresses all three.

### Upload Routing — `uploadFileSmart`

The frontend decides which path to take based on file size and environment:

| Condition | Path | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| `file.size > 100 MB` | Reject | Hard cap |
| Local dev (any size) | Direct upload to `/api/upload` | No GCS credentials locally |
| Production, ≤ 25 MB | Direct upload to `/api/upload` | Fits within Firebase's 32 MB limit (with multipart overhead) |
| Production, > 25 MB | Signed URL → GCS → async processing | Bypasses Firebase entirely |

### Large File Path (> 25 MB in Production)

```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

**1. Signed URL Generation** (`POST /api/upload/signed-url` → `GcsUtil.generateSignedUploadUrl`)

The backend generates a V4 signed URL scoped to `uploads/{userId}/{fileId}/{filename}`. The URL is a pre-authenticated PUT endpoint on `storage.googleapis.com` that expires in 30 minutes. The userId in the path provides per-user isolation.

**2. Direct-to-GCS Upload** (`uploadToGcs` in `client.ts`)

The browser PUTs the file directly to the signed URL. This uses `XMLHttpRequest` instead of `fetch` because XHR supports `upload.progress` events — fetch does not. For a 50 MB file over a slow connection, the user sees a real progress bar.

Two infrastructure requirements:
- **GCS CORS** (`cors.json`): The bucket must allow PUT from the app's origins, otherwise the browser's preflight OPTIONS request fails
- **CSP header** (`helmet` config): `connectSrc` must include `https://storage.googleapis.com`, otherwise the Content Security Policy blocks the XHR

**3. BullMQ Job Queue** (`POST /api/upload/process`)

After the file lands in GCS, the frontend tells the backend to process it. The backend enqueues a job via BullMQ and returns immediately:
1. Adds a job to the `file-processing` queue with `jobId = fileId` (natural deduplication)
2. Returns `{ jobId, status: 'queued' }` immediately (< 100ms)
3. The in-process BullMQ worker picks up the job asynchronously

This is a unified path for both production and development — all uploads go through the queue. The UI is unblocked immediately after enqueue; the user can chat or upload more files while processing continues in the background.

Queue configuration:
- **Concurrency:** 2 jobs in parallel (allows overlap — one downloading while one embeds)
- **Retries:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff (10s base delay)
- **Lock duration:** 5 minutes (accommodates large files)
- **Retention:** Completed jobs kept 24 hours, failed jobs kept 7 days
- **Stall detection:** BullMQ automatically retries jobs if the worker crashes mid-processing

Security: the endpoint verifies `gcsPath.startsWith('uploads/{userId}/')` so users can't reference other users' files, and checks `fileExists` in GCS before processing.

**4. Progress Tracking & Polling** (`pollJobStatus` in `client.ts`)

The frontend polls `GET /api/upload/status/{jobId}` every 3 seconds. The status endpoint reads directly from BullMQ (not manual Redis keys) and includes progress stages reported by the worker:

| Poll Result | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| `status: 'queued'` | Continue polling (job waiting for worker) |
| `status: 'processing'` + `progress.stage` | Continue polling, update UI with stage (downloading, extracting text, embedding, cleaning up) |
| `status: 'completed'` | Return the result |
| `status: 'failed'` | Throw with error message |
| Auth redirect / non-API URL | Skip this poll, retry next (token may have expired) |
| 10-minute deadline exceeded | Throw "timed out" |

Auth resilience: Clerk tokens can expire during a long processing job. The polling loop catches `Session expired` errors and continues — `getToken` refreshes the token on the next iteration.

**5. File Processing** (`processGcsFile` in `src/ingest/processGcsFile.ts`)

The BullMQ worker calls `processGcsFile` with an `onProgress` callback that reports each stage back to the job:

1. Downloads the file from GCS into a Node.js Buffer → `progress: 'downloading'`
2. Extracts text using LangChain loaders (PDFLoader, DocxLoader, or raw UTF-8) → `progress: 'extracting_text'`
3. Extracts title from PDF metadata → content heuristics → cleaned filename
4. Calls `ingestDocument` (chunking + embedding + storage) → `progress: 'embedding'`
5. Deletes the file from GCS (data is in the database now) → `progress: 'cleaning_up'`

### Batched Embedding — `ingestDocument`

The old approach called `embedText()` once per chunk — 200 API calls for a 200-chunk document, which hit Voyage AI's rate limit and took 60+ seconds. The batched approach:

| Chunks | Batch Size | API Calls | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 10 | 64 | 1 | 10x fewer |
| 200 | 64 | 4 (sizes: 64, 64, 64, 8) | 50x fewer |

Voyage AI supports up to 128 texts per batch call. We use 64 to stay under RPM limits with retries. A 500ms pause between batches provides additional rate limit headroom.

Each batch call is wrapped in `withRetry` with aggressive settings: 5 attempts, 2-second base delay, exponential backoff with jitter. The retry utility only retries transient errors (429, 5xx, network failures) — not auth or bad request errors.

### Safe Response Parsing — `safeFetchJson`

Every `fetch` call in the frontend parses responses through `safeFetchJson`, which handles the cases where Firebase/Cloud Run returns HTML instead of JSON:

| Response State | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| `response.redirected` or URL not `/api/` | Throws "Session expired" (Clerk auth redirect) |
| OK + valid JSON | Returns parsed data |
| OK + HTML body | Throws "Unexpected response from server" |
| Error (5xx) + JSON body | Returns parsed error (so frontend can show backend's message) |
| Error (5xx) + HTML body | Throws "Server error (502)" |

### Configuration

| Constant | Location | Value | Purpose |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| `LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD` | `client.ts` | 25 MB | Files above this use the GCS path |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE` | `client.ts` | 100 MB | Hard reject above this |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `client.ts` | 3,000 ms | Polling frequency |
| `POLL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `client.ts` | 10 min | Max wait before "timed out" |
| `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE` | `ingestDocument.ts` | 64 | Texts per Voyage AI call |
| `BATCH_DELAY_MS` | `ingestDocument.ts` | 500 ms | Pause between batches |
| Queue concurrency | `workers.ts` | 2 | Parallel jobs per worker instance |
| Queue attempts | `queues.ts` | 3 | Max retries per job |
| Queue backoff | `queues.ts` | 10s exponential | Delay between retries |
| `removeOnComplete` | `queues.ts` | 24 hours | Completed job retention |
| `removeOnFail` | `queues.ts` | 7 days | Failed job retention |
| `lockDuration` | `workers.ts` | 5 min | Worker lock for large files |

## Scaling Roadmap

### Current Architecture

Chat requests are synchronous (Express → LLM → response). File processing is queued via BullMQ with an in-process worker. This is optimal for simplicity and latency at moderate scale.

**Already implemented:**
- **BullMQ job queue** for file upload processing — retries, progress tracking, stall detection, non-blocking UI
- **In-process worker** (concurrency 2) — runs alongside Express in the same Cloud Run instance

### Phase 1: Separate Worker Service

```
User → Express API (Cloud Run)           Worker Service (Cloud Run)
              |                                    |
              |-- queue.add() --> Redis <-- worker.process()
              |                                    |-- download, extract, embed
```

Split the BullMQ worker into a dedicated Cloud Run service. The queue code is already architected for this — `src/queue/workers.ts` can run standalone. This lets you scale API instances and worker instances independently.

### Phase 2: Chat Queue + SSE

```
User → Express API → Push to Queue → Return "accepted" (50ms)
                          ↓
                    Worker → LLM call → DB query → Write result
                          ↓
                    Redis Pub/Sub → SSE push to client
```

Move chat requests through the queue when LLM latency becomes a throughput bottleneck. The heavy logic (`getFormattedAnswerToUserinput`) is already isolated and can be moved into a worker with minimal refactoring.

### Phase 3: Connection Pooling + Read Replicas

At high read volume, the database becomes the bottleneck:
- **PgBouncer** for connection pooling (reduce per-connection overhead)
- **Read replicas** for embedding search queries (separate read/write traffic)
- **Redis caching** for frequently accessed embeddings and user profiles

## Retrieval Quality Evaluation

The retrieval pipeline is tested with a dedicated evaluation suite that measures ranking quality.

### Metrics

| Metric             | Description                                                       | Threshold |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **MRR**            | Mean Reciprocal Rank — average of 1/rank of first relevant result | ≥ 0.65    |
| **Recall@5**       | Fraction of relevant docs appearing in top 5 results              | ≥ 0.65    |
| **Disambiguation** | Correct doc ranks above keyword-similar-but-wrong doc             | ≥ 0.70    |

### Test Categories

| Category       | What it tests                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Temporal       | Date range filtering ("what did I do in 2023")                                                                 |
| Semantic       | Meaning-based retrieval without exact keywords                                                                 |
| Keyword        | Direct term matching ("ClickHouse migration")                                                                  |
| Study content  | Document content retrieval                                                                                     |
| Disambiguation | Correct doc outranks keyword-similar doc (e.g., "axiom in math" ranks math notes above "Axiom" company resume) |
| Edge cases     | Typos, long queries, single-word queries                                                                       |

### Running Tests

```bash
# Seed test data (required once)
npm run test:seed

# Run retrieval evaluation
npm run test:retrieval
```

### Test Fixtures

Test documents and queries are defined in `src/__tests__/fixtures/testDocuments.ts`. Add new test cases as your corpus grows to catch regressions.

## Agent Tracing

The agent includes an internal tracing system that captures structured spans for each node in the workflow.

### Trace Structure

```typescript
interface AgentTrace {
  traceId: string;
  queryId: string;
  query: string;
  startTime: number;
  spans: TraceSpan[]; // Append-only, each node adds one
  outcome: TraceOutcome; // Set once at the end
}

interface TraceSpan {
  node: string; // 'retrievalGate', 'hybridSearch', etc.
  startTime: number;
  durationMs: number;
  meta: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
}

interface TraceOutcome {
  status: 'success' | 'refused' | 'clarified' | 'error';
  reason?: string;
  triggeringSpan?: string;
  durationMs: number;
}
```

### What Each Node Captures

| Node                        | Metadata                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `retrievalGate`             | queryType, wasRewritten, shouldRetrieveDocuments, shouldRetrieveMemories           |
| `retrieveMemoriesAndChunks` | profileMemories, contextualMemories, chunksRetrieved (+ hybrid search diagnostics) |
| `injectContext`             | documentsUsed, memoriesUsed, contextTokens, responseLength                         |
| `extractAndStoreKnowledge`  | contentType, memoriesAdded, studyMaterialIngested                                  |
| `clarificationResponse`     | responseLength                                                                     |

### Retrieval Diagnostics

The `retrieveMemoriesAndChunks` node captures detailed pipeline diagnostics to pinpoint where retrieval quality degrades:

| Stage             | Metrics                                                                                           | What it tells you                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hybrid Search** | `embeddingCandidates`, `keywordCandidates`, `fusionOverlap`, `fusedCount`, `topEmbeddingDistance` | How many chunks each search found, overlap between them |
| **Pipeline**      | `afterRelevanceFilter`, `afterDedup`, `afterBudget`                                               | Chunk counts after each filtering stage                 |
| **Quality**       | `topChunkDistance`, `scoreSpread`, `uniqueDocuments`                                              | Confidence signals for retrieval quality                |
| **Temporal**      | `temporalFilterApplied`, `queryYear`                                                              | Whether date filtering was used                         |

**Example trace for debugging:**

```
embeddingCandidates: 40  →  keywordCandidates: 12  →  fusedCount: 35
    ↓
afterRelevanceFilter: 28  →  afterDedup: 22  →  afterBudget: 8
```

**Interpreting the diagnostics:**

- High `embeddingCandidates` but low `afterRelevanceFilter` → relevance rules too strict
- High `afterDedup` but low `afterBudget` → budget constraints cutting relevant chunks
- Large `scoreSpread` → retrieved chunks have varying quality
- `fusionOverlap` near 0 → embedding and keyword searches found different results (query ambiguity)

### Design Principles

- **Append-only spans**: Each node pushes its span, never mutates previous spans
- **Single outcome**: Set once at the end of the workflow
- **Stored in session state**: Flows through AgentState → Redis, expires with session
- **LangSmith compatible**: Trace data can be attached to LangSmith span metadata

### Trace Pruning

Traces are for observability, not a secondary memory system. Automatic pruning prevents bloat:

| Limit                          | Value     | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `MAX_RUNS_PER_SESSION`         | 50        | Cap trace history per session  |
| `MAX_SPANS_PER_RUN`            | 100       | Limit events per trace         |
| `MAX_CANDIDATES_PER_RETRIEVAL` | 10        | Limit logged chunk candidates  |
| `MAX_BYTES_PER_RUN`            | 100 KB    | Hard cap on trace size         |
| `MAX_SNIPPET_LENGTH`           | 100 chars | Truncate content in candidates |
| `MAX_QUERY_LENGTH`             | 500 chars | Truncate long queries          |

**When pruning happens:**

Pruning occurs at the **end of the workflow** in terminal nodes (`extractAndStoreKnowledge` and `clarificationResponse`), after the outcome is set but before the trace is returned. This ensures the complete trace is captured before pruning.

**What gets pruned:**

- Raw chunk content → replaced with short snippets
- Full embeddings → dropped entirely
- Large metadata values → truncated to 200 chars
- Old spans → only most recent N kept

**Candidate summaries:**

Instead of storing full chunk data, traces store lightweight summaries:

```typescript
type CandidateSummary = {
  id: string;
  documentId: string;
  score: number; // distance or confidence
  snippet: string; // first 100 chars
};
```

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { TraceUtil, TRACE_LIMITS } from './util/TraceUtil';

// Create pruned candidate summaries
const summaries = TraceUtil.createCandidateSummaries(chunks);

// Prune a trace before storage
const prunedTrace = TraceUtil.pruneTrace(trace);

// Prune session trace history
const prunedHistory = TraceUtil.pruneSessionTraces(traces);
```

### LangSmith Integration

LangGraph automatically traces all workflow runs to LangSmith when configured.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Add to .env.local
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=ls__...
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=study-agent
```

**Custom Metadata:**

The trace utilities convert our domain-specific trace data to LangSmith-compatible metadata:

```typescript
import { LangSmithUtil } from './util/LangSmithUtil';

// Convert trace to LangSmith metadata
const metadata = LangSmithUtil.traceToMetadata(trace);
// {
//   'agent.traceId': '...',
//   'agent.outcome': 'success',
//   'agent.queryType': 'study_content',
//   'retrieval.embeddingCandidates': 40,
//   'retrieval.afterBudget': 8,
//   ...
// }

// Get a one-line summary for logging
const summary = LangSmithUtil.traceSummaryLine(trace);
// "[success] | 1234ms | type=study_content | chunks=8 | memories=2 | dist=0.234"

// Detect quality issues for alerting
const issues = LangSmithUtil.detectQualityIssues(trace);
// ['weak_top_match', 'slow_execution']
```

**Viewing in LangSmith:**

1. Go to your LangSmith project
2. Filter runs by custom metadata (e.g., `agent.outcome = error`)
3. Set up alerts for quality issues
4. Build dashboards tracking `retrieval.*` metrics

### Trace API Endpoint

The server exposes trace data via API:

```bash
# Get latest trace
curl http://localhost:3000/api/trace

# Include trace in chat response
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is in my notes?", "includeTrace": true}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "trace": {
    "traceId": "abc-123",
    "outcome": { "status": "success", "durationMs": 1234 },
    "spans": [...]
  },
  "metrics": { "agent.queryType": "study_content", ... },
  "issues": [],
  "summary": "[success] | 1234ms | type=study_content | chunks=8"
}
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit           # Fast unit tests (~200ms)
npm run test:smoke          # End-to-end smoke tests (~20s)
npm run test:retrieval      # Retrieval quality metrics (~2s)
npm run test:integration    # Comprehensive pipeline tests (~2min)

# Setup

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### Smoke Tests

Minimal end-to-end tests to verify the agent pipeline is wired correctly.

| Test           | Path                                 | Verifies                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Happy path     | Gate → Retrieval → Context → Extract | Full pipeline executes, success outcome         |
| Alternate path | Gate → Context (skip retrieval)      | Conversational queries skip retrieval correctly |

These are NOT quality evaluations — they just verify the pipeline doesn't break.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests run fast (~200ms) with no external dependencies. All external services are mocked.

**`documentUtil.test.ts`** - 28 tests covering:

| Function                | Tests                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `applyBudget`           | `maxChunks`, `maxPerDoc`, `maxContextTokens`, `maxChunkTokens`, combined constraints, empty input    |
| `estimateTokens`        | ~4 chars/token heuristic, empty string, rounding, whitespace handling                                |
| `cosineSimilarity`      | Identical vectors (1.0), orthogonal (0.0), opposite (-1.0), symmetry, high-dimensional, zero vectors |
| `removeDuplicateChunks` | High similarity removal, threshold behavior, missing embeddings                                      |

**`safeFetchJson.test.ts`** - 6 tests covering:

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| OK response + valid JSON | Returns parsed data |
| OK response + HTML body | Throws "Unexpected response from server" |
| `response.redirected = true` | Throws "Session expired" |
| URL without `/api/` | Throws "Session expired" |
| Error (500) + JSON body | Returns parsed error JSON |
| Error (502) + HTML body | Throws "Server error (502)" |

**`ingestBatching.test.ts`** - 5 tests covering:

| Scenario | Assertion |
|----------|-----------|
| 10 chunks (batch size 64) | 1 `embedBatch` call |
| 200 chunks (batch size 64) | 4 calls with sizes [64, 64, 64, 8] |
| 0 chunks | No `embedBatch` calls, returns chunkCount 0 |
| Embedding mapping | Each chunk gets correct embedding in `upsertChunks` |
| Temporal extraction | `extractTemporalRange` called for every chunk, data flows to DB |

**`embedBatch.test.ts`** - 5 tests covering:

| Scenario | Assertion |
|----------|-----------|
| Empty input | Returns `[]`, no API call |
| Single text | Calls API with `['text']`, returns 1 embedding |
| Multiple texts | Returns correct count, passes full array to API |
| Mismatched response count | Throws "expected N results, got M" |
| Retry config | `withRetry` called with `maxAttempts: 5, baseDelayMs: 2000` |

### Integration Tests

Integration tests run the full agent pipeline and assert on trace outcomes. These tests hit real APIs (Anthropic, VoyageAI) and require environment variables.

**What the tests verify:**

| Test Category      | Assertions                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trace Outcomes     | `success` for valid queries, `clarified` for ambiguous ones |
| Retrieval Pipeline | Documents retrieved when expected, diagnostics captured     |
| Temporal Filtering | `queryYear` extracted and applied correctly                 |
| Performance        | Total duration < 30s, no span > 15s                         |
| Error Resilience   | Minimal/long queries handled gracefully                     |

**Example test:**

```typescript
it('should retrieve documents for study content queries', async () => {
  const { trace } = await runAgent('What does my resume say?');

  const gateSpan = trace?.spans.find((s) => s.node === 'retrievalGate');
  expect(gateSpan?.meta.shouldRetrieveDocuments).toBe(true);

  const retrievalSpan = trace?.spans.find((s) => s.node === 'retrieveMemoriesAndChunks');
  expect(retrievalSpan?.meta.embeddingCandidates).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

**Test Configuration:**

Tests use a 60-second timeout (configured in `vitest.config.ts`) to accommodate API latency. Environment variables are loaded via `src/__tests__/setup.ts`.

## Evaluation Suite

The evaluation suite tests end-to-end agent behavior with structured assertions. Unlike unit tests, these run the full agent pipeline and evaluate response quality.

### Running Evaluations

```bash
# 1. Seed test fixtures (required once, or after changing fixtures)
npx tsx src/evals/seed.ts

# 2. Run local evaluations
npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts

# Run with verbose output
npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts --verbose

# Run specific category
npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts --category off_topic

# 3. Run with LangSmith tracking (requires LANGCHAIN_API_KEY)
npx tsx src/evals/runExperiment.ts
```

### Test Categories

| Category               | Expected Behavior | What it tests                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `study_content`        | ANSWER            | Questions about documents/notes               |
| `personal`             | ANSWER            | User-specific info (goals, history)           |
| `temporal_containment` | ANSWER            | Time-bound queries ("What did I do in 2023?") |
| `workflow`             | ANSWER            | Tool-triggering queries ("quiz me on X")      |
| `off_topic`            | REFUSE            | Lifestyle/opinion questions (stocks, fashion) |
| `unclear`              | CLARIFY           | Vague/ambiguous queries                       |

### Evaluators

Each evaluator returns a score (0-1), weight, and critical flag:

| Evaluator      | Weight | Critical | What it checks                            |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `behavior`     | 3.0    | Yes      | ANSWER/REFUSE/CLARIFY matches expected    |
| `routing`      | 2.0    | No       | Gate classified query correctly           |
| `retrieval`    | 1.0    | No       | Retrieved when expected, skipped when not |
| `budget`       | 1.0    | No       | Latency and token usage within thresholds |
| `contains_any` | 1.5    | No       | Response contains expected keywords       |
| `must_cover`   | 1.5    | No       | Response covers expected topics           |
| `amount`       | 2.0    | No       | Numeric values match expected             |

**Scoring:**

- Critical evaluators must pass (score = 1.0) or entire test fails
- Non-critical evaluators contribute to weighted average
- Pass threshold: weighted score ≥ 70%

### Behavior Detection

The evaluator uses **trace-first** detection with text fallback:

1. Check gate `queryType` from trace (most reliable)
   - `off_topic` → REFUSE
   - `needsClarification` → CLARIFY
2. Fall back to response text pattern matching
   - Refusal patterns: "I'm a study assistant", "outside my expertise", etc.
   - Clarification patterns: "could you clarify", "what are you referring to", etc.

### Test Fixtures

Test documents are defined in `src/evals/fixtures/evalDocuments.ts` with fake data:

| Document       | Content                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| User Profile   | Fake career info, severance ($42,500), work history |
| Lost in Middle | Summary of position effects in LLM context          |
| ReAct Paper    | Reasoning + acting framework explanation            |
| React Docs     | JavaScript library overview                         |
| Hair Loss      | Finasteride vs dutasteride comparison               |

The seed script ingests these under a dedicated `EVAL_USER_ID` so tests run against consistent data regardless of your personal documents.

### Adding New Test Cases

1. Add the test case to `src/evals/dataset.ts`:

```typescript
{
  userQuery: 'What is transformer architecture?',
  category: 'study_content',
  expected_behavior: 'ANSWER',
  answer_must_contain_any: ['attention', 'encoder', 'decoder'],
  dataset_split: ['base'],
}
```

2. Add corresponding fixture document to `src/evals/fixtures/evalDocuments.ts` if needed

3. Re-run seed: `npx tsx src/evals/seed.ts`

4. Run evals: `npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts`
