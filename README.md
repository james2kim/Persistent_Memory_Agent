## Memory Architecture

### Short-Term Memory (Redis)

Session-scoped memory with 24-hour TTL:

| Key Pattern                     | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `session:<id>`                  | Session state (messages, summary, taskState) |
| `checkpoint:<thread_id>:latest` | LangGraph checkpoint for workflow resumption |
| `user:<id>:active_session`      | Maps user to their active session            |

**Stale Session Archival**: When a session is inactive for 12+ hours but accessed again, the session summary is persisted to long-term memory before continuing. This ensures important context survives session expiration.

### Long-Term Memory (PostgreSQL + pgvector)

Permanent storage for extracted knowledge and documents:

**memories table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type` | fact, preference, goal, decision, summary |
| `content` | The extracted memory content |
| `confidence` | 0.0-1.0 extraction confidence |
| `embedding` | VoyageAI embedding (vector) for semantic search |
| `user_id` | Owner of the memory |

**documents table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `source` | File path or URL |
| `title` | Document title |
| `metadata` | JSON metadata |
| `user_id` | Owner |

**chunks table:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `content` | Chunk text |
| `embedding` | vector for cosine similarity (HNSW indexed) |
| `search_vector` | tsvector for BM25 keyword search |
| `start_year` | Temporal range start (extracted) |
| `end_year` | Temporal range end (null = "Present") |
| `document_id` | Parent document |

## Workflow Nodes

### 1. retrievalGate

Routes queries based on rule-based classification + LLM fallback + deterministic policy.

**Rule-Based Classification** (instant, free):
Handles 60-70% of queries without LLM calls:

- Greetings/thanks → `conversational`
- Personal statements ("I am/like/prefer...") → `personal`
- Personal questions ("my goal", "what did I say") → `personal`
- Topic questions ("explain X", "what is Y") → `study_content`
- Lifestyle advice ("should I nap?") → `off_topic`

**LLM Assessment** (Haiku - for ambiguous cases):

- `queryType`: personal | study_content | general_knowledge | conversational | off_topic | unclear
- `referencesPersonalContext`: boolean

**Policy** (deterministic):

- `conversational` or `off_topic` → skip all retrieval
- `study_content` → search documents + memories (for personalization)
- `personal` → search documents + memories with full budget
- `unclear` → request clarification

### 2. retrieveMemoriesAndChunks

Executes hybrid search based on gate decision.

**Two-Tier Memory Retrieval:**
Profile memories (preferences, facts) are always relevant for personalization but don't match well via semantic similarity (e.g., "give me a code example" won't semantically match "prefers TypeScript"). Solution:

1. **Tier 1 - Profile memories**: Fetch preferences + facts by confidence (no embedding needed)
2. **Tier 2 - Contextual memories**: Similarity search for goals, decisions, summaries

| Budget  | Profile | Contextual | Total |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Full    | 3       | 2          | 5     |
| Minimal | 2       | 0          | 2     |

**Hybrid Document Search Pipeline:**

1. Extract temporal year from query (e.g., "what did I do in 2023" → 2023)
2. Run in parallel:
   - **Embedding search**: pgvector cosine similarity with optional temporal filter
   - **Keyword search**: PostgreSQL tsvector/BM25 with same temporal filter
3. **RRF Fusion**: Combine results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion
   - `score = Σ(1 / (k + rank))` where k=60
4. Deduplicate and return top K chunks

### 3. injectContext

Builds the context block and generates the response.

**U-Shape Distribution** (based on "Lost in the Middle" research):

- LLMs attend most to beginning and end of context
- Most relevant items placed at front and back
- Least relevant items buried in the middle

```
Input (by relevance):  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output (U-shape):      [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2]
```

**Context Format:**

```
## User Context
- [goal] Complete the study plan by Friday
- [preference] Prefers concise explanations

## Sources
[Source: Resume.pdf]
Software Engineer at Axiom, June 2022 – Present...

[Source: Biology Notes.md]
Cellular respiration is the process...
```

### 4. extractAndStoreKnowledge

Background extraction of knowledge from the conversation (runs async, doesn't block response).

**Knowledge Extraction:**

- Classifies input as `study_material`, `personal_memory`, or `ephemeral`
- Study material → ingested as document chunks with embeddings
- Personal memory → stored with type classification:
  - `preference`: User likes/prefers something (language, tools, learning style)
  - `fact`: Objective info (job, school, current projects)
  - `goal`: Future-oriented aspirations
  - `decision`: Past choices made
- Deduplicates against existing memories (cosine similarity ≥ 0.9)

**Message Summarization (Background):**
Prevents unbounded context growth while preserving important information.

| Trigger           | Action                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Messages reach 15 | Summarize oldest 10, keep newest 5 |
| Result            | Messages oscillate between 5-15    |

```
Before: [m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10, m11, m12, m13, m14, m15]
                    ↓ summarize oldest 10
After:  [summary] + [m11, m12, m13, m14, m15]
```

The summary is appended to the session's running summary, preserving context across pruning cycles.

### 5. clarificationResponse

Handles ambiguous queries by asking for clarification.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. HNSW Vector Index

Similarity search on the `chunks.embedding` column uses an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index instead of sequential scan. HNSW builds a multi-layered graph over the vectors — top layers have sparse, long-range connections for coarse navigation, bottom layers have dense, short-range connections for precise lookup. Search traverses top-down in O(log n) hops rather than computing distance against every row (O(n)).

| Parameter         | Value                 | Effect                                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `m`               | 16                    | Max connections per node. Higher = better recall, more memory           |
| `ef_construction` | 64                    | Build-time candidate list. Higher = better graph quality, slower builds |
| `ef_search`       | 40 (pgvector default) | Query-time candidate list. Tunable per-query via `SET hnsw.ef_search`   |
| Operator class    | `vector_cosine_ops`   | Matches the `<=>` cosine distance operator used in queries              |

Tradeoff: ~99%+ recall vs exact search, which is negligible — chunking strategy and embedding quality are the actual retrieval bottlenecks.

### 2. Hybrid Search with Temporal Filtering

Pure semantic search misses queries like "what did I do in 2023" because embeddings don't capture temporal specificity well. The hybrid approach:

- **Embedding search**: Catches semantic meaning ("work experience" ≈ "job")
- **Keyword search**: Catches exact terms ("2023", "Axiom")
- **Temporal filter**: `start_year <= queryYear AND (end_year IS NULL OR end_year >= queryYear)`
- **RRF fusion**: Combines both rankings fairly

### 3. Retrieval Gate (Rule-Based + LLM Fallback)

Most queries can be classified without an LLM call:

- **Rule-based filter**: Regex patterns handle greetings, personal statements, topic questions (~60-70% of queries)
- **LLM fallback**: Haiku handles ambiguous cases that don't match patterns
- **Deterministic policy**: Code decides retrieval strategy based on classification

This reduces latency and cost while maintaining accuracy.

### 4. Two-Tier Memory Retrieval

Pure semantic similarity fails for personalization queries:

- "Give me a code example" doesn't semantically match "prefers TypeScript"
- But the TypeScript preference is essential for good code generation

Solution: separate profile retrieval from contextual retrieval:

- **Profile memories** (preferences, facts): Always fetched by confidence, no embedding needed
- **Contextual memories** (goals, decisions): Fetched by semantic similarity

This ensures user preferences are always available for generation tasks without relying on embedding similarity.

### 5. Off-Topic Handling

Off-topic queries (stock tips, medical advice) skip retrieval entirely and get a clean redirect: "I'm a study assistant—happy to help with learning or organizing your notes."

No mention of "I didn't find relevant documents" because that's confusing for genuinely off-topic questions.

### 6. Session Summary Persistence

When a session goes stale (12+ hours inactive), the accumulated session summary is stored as a long-term memory. This captures:

- Decisions made during the session
- Goals established
- Important context

Even after the Redis session expires, this knowledge persists.

### 7. U-Shape Context Distribution

Based on "Lost in the Middle" research showing LLMs attend poorly to middle content:

- Most relevant → front (high attention)
- Second most relevant → back (high attention)
- Least relevant → middle (low attention)

### 8. Adaptive Model Selection

The response generation step dynamically chooses between Haiku (fast/cheap) and Sonnet (capable/expensive) based on retrieval confidence:

| Scenario                                     | Model  | Rationale                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| No context needed                            | Haiku  | Conversational queries don't need heavy reasoning           |
| Good retrieval (≥2 chunks, distance ≤0.6)    | Haiku  | Synthesizing from strong sources is straightforward         |
| Weak retrieval (few chunks or high distance) | Sonnet | Better at reasoning with sparse info, admitting uncertainty |

This reduces cost and latency for ~70% of queries while preserving quality for complex cases.

### 9. Document Title Citations

Sources cite document titles (e.g., `[Source: Resume.pdf]`) instead of opaque chunk indices, making responses more useful.

### 10. Production Resilience

Three layers protect against transient external API failures:

**Rate Limiting**: Express middleware limits each user to a fixed request rate on `/api/chat` and `/api/upload`, preventing abuse and runaway costs.

**Retry with Exponential Backoff**: All LLM (Anthropic) and embedding (VoyageAI) calls are wrapped in a generic `withRetry` utility. On transient failures (429, 5xx, network errors), requests retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff and jitter (~1s, ~2s, ~4s). Auth errors (401/403) and bad requests (400) fail immediately.

**Embedding Fallback**: If the embedding API fails even after retries, the retrieval pipeline degrades gracefully instead of returning empty results:

- Document search falls back to keyword-only (PostgreSQL full-text search)
- Profile memories (preferences, facts) are still retrieved (no embedding needed)
- Contextual memories (goals, decisions) are skipped since they require similarity search
- The `embeddingFallback` flag is captured in trace metadata for observability

### 11. Authentication with Clerk

Authentication is handled by Clerk, a managed auth service. This was chosen over building custom auth because:

- Not the focus of this project (learning agent architecture, not auth)
- Production-ready security out of the box
- Simple integration with React and Express

**Authentication Flow:**

1. User signs in via Clerk modal (supports email, OAuth providers)
2. Frontend passes JWT token with each API request via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
3. Backend verifies token via `requireAuth()` middleware from `@clerk/express`
4. `getOrCreateUser()` finds or creates a user record in PostgreSQL linked to the Clerk ID
5. All data (memories, documents, sessions) is scoped to the authenticated user

## File Upload Pipeline

File upload has three constraints in production: Firebase's **32 MB request body limit**, Firebase's **60-second request timeout**, and Voyage AI's **rate limit** on embedding calls. The upload pipeline addresses all three.

### Upload Routing — `uploadFileSmart`

The frontend decides which path to take based on file size and environment:

| Condition | Path | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| `file.size > 100 MB` | Reject | Hard cap |
| Local dev (any size) | Direct upload to `/api/upload` | No GCS credentials locally |
| Production, ≤ 25 MB | Direct upload to `/api/upload` | Fits within Firebase's 32 MB limit (with multipart overhead) |
| Production, > 25 MB | Signed URL → GCS → async processing | Bypasses Firebase entirely |

### Large File Path (> 25 MB in Production)

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

**1. Signed URL Generation** (`POST /api/upload/signed-url` → `GcsUtil.generateSignedUploadUrl`)

The backend generates a V4 signed URL scoped to `uploads/{userId}/{fileId}/{filename}`. The URL is a pre-authenticated PUT endpoint on `storage.googleapis.com` that expires in 30 minutes. The userId in the path provides per-user isolation.

**2. Direct-to-GCS Upload** (`uploadToGcs` in `client.ts`)

The browser PUTs the file directly to the signed URL. This uses `XMLHttpRequest` instead of `fetch` because XHR supports `upload.progress` events — fetch does not. For a 50 MB file over a slow connection, the user sees a real progress bar.

Two infrastructure requirements:
- **GCS CORS** (`cors.json`): The bucket must allow PUT from the app's origins, otherwise the browser's preflight OPTIONS request fails
- **CSP header** (`helmet` config): `connectSrc` must include `https://storage.googleapis.com`, otherwise the Content Security Policy blocks the XHR

**3. BullMQ Job Queue** (`POST /api/upload/process`)

After the file lands in GCS, the frontend tells the backend to process it. The backend enqueues a job via BullMQ and returns immediately:
1. Adds a job to the `file-processing` queue with `jobId = fileId` (natural deduplication)
2. Returns `{ jobId, status: 'queued' }` immediately (< 100ms)
3. The in-process BullMQ worker picks up the job asynchronously

This is a unified path for both production and development — all uploads go through the queue. The UI is unblocked immediately after enqueue; the user can chat or upload more files while processing continues in the background.

Queue configuration:
- **Concurrency:** 2 jobs in parallel (allows overlap — one downloading while one embeds)
- **Retries:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff (10s base delay)
- **Lock duration:** 5 minutes (accommodates large files)
- **Retention:** Completed jobs kept 24 hours, failed jobs kept 7 days
- **Stall detection:** BullMQ automatically retries jobs if the worker crashes mid-processing

Security: the endpoint verifies `gcsPath.startsWith('uploads/{userId}/')` so users can't reference other users' files, and checks `fileExists` in GCS before processing.

**4. Progress Tracking & Polling** (`pollJobStatus` in `client.ts`)

The frontend polls `GET /api/upload/status/{jobId}` every 3 seconds. The status endpoint reads directly from BullMQ (not manual Redis keys) and includes progress stages reported by the worker:

| Poll Result | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| `status: 'queued'` | Continue polling (job waiting for worker) |
| `status: 'processing'` + `progress.stage` | Continue polling, update UI with stage (downloading, extracting text, embedding, cleaning up) |
| `status: 'completed'` | Return the result |
| `status: 'failed'` | Throw with error message |
| Auth redirect / non-API URL | Skip this poll, retry next (token may have expired) |
| 10-minute deadline exceeded | Throw "timed out" |

Auth resilience: Clerk tokens can expire during a long processing job. The polling loop catches `Session expired` errors and continues — `getToken` refreshes the token on the next iteration.

**5. File Processing** (`processGcsFile` in `src/ingest/processGcsFile.ts`)

The BullMQ worker calls `processGcsFile` with an `onProgress` callback that reports each stage back to the job:

1. Downloads the file from GCS into a Node.js Buffer → `progress: 'downloading'`
2. Extracts text using LangChain loaders (PDFLoader, DocxLoader, or raw UTF-8) → `progress: 'extracting_text'`
3. Extracts title from PDF metadata → content heuristics → cleaned filename
4. Calls `ingestDocument` (chunking + embedding + storage) → `progress: 'embedding'`
5. Deletes the file from GCS (data is in the database now) → `progress: 'cleaning_up'`

### Batched Embedding — `ingestDocument`

The old approach called `embedText()` once per chunk — 200 API calls for a 200-chunk document, which hit Voyage AI's rate limit and took 60+ seconds. The batched approach:

| Chunks | Batch Size | API Calls | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 10 | 64 | 1 | 10x fewer |
| 200 | 64 | 4 (sizes: 64, 64, 64, 8) | 50x fewer |

Voyage AI supports up to 128 texts per batch call. We use 64 to stay under RPM limits with retries. A 500ms pause between batches provides additional rate limit headroom.

Each batch call is wrapped in `withRetry` with aggressive settings: 5 attempts, 2-second base delay, exponential backoff with jitter. The retry utility only retries transient errors (429, 5xx, network failures) — not auth or bad request errors.

### Safe Response Parsing — `safeFetchJson`

Every `fetch` call in the frontend parses responses through `safeFetchJson`, which handles the cases where Firebase/Cloud Run returns HTML instead of JSON:

| Response State | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| `response.redirected` or URL not `/api/` | Throws "Session expired" (Clerk auth redirect) |
| OK + valid JSON | Returns parsed data |
| OK + HTML body | Throws "Unexpected response from server" |
| Error (5xx) + JSON body | Returns parsed error (so frontend can show backend's message) |
| Error (5xx) + HTML body | Throws "Server error (502)" |

### Configuration

| Constant | Location | Value | Purpose |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| `LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD` | `client.ts` | 25 MB | Files above this use the GCS path |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE` | `client.ts` | 100 MB | Hard reject above this |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `client.ts` | 3,000 ms | Polling frequency |
| `POLL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `client.ts` | 10 min | Max wait before "timed out" |
| `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE` | `ingestDocument.ts` | 64 | Texts per Voyage AI call |
| `BATCH_DELAY_MS` | `ingestDocument.ts` | 500 ms | Pause between batches |
| Queue concurrency | `workers.ts` | 2 | Parallel jobs per worker instance |
| Queue attempts | `queues.ts` | 3 | Max retries per job |
| Queue backoff | `queues.ts` | 10s exponential | Delay between retries |
| `removeOnComplete` | `queues.ts` | 24 hours | Completed job retention |
| `removeOnFail` | `queues.ts` | 7 days | Failed job retention |
| `lockDuration` | `workers.ts` | 5 min | Worker lock for large files |

## Scaling Roadmap

### Current Architecture

Chat requests are synchronous (Express → LLM → response). File processing is queued via BullMQ with an in-process worker. This is optimal for simplicity and latency at moderate scale.

**Already implemented:**
- **BullMQ job queue** for file upload processing — retries, progress tracking, stall detection, non-blocking UI
- **In-process worker** (concurrency 2) — runs alongside Express in the same Cloud Run instance

### Phase 1: Separate Worker Service

```
User → Express API (Cloud Run)           Worker Service (Cloud Run)
              |                                    |
              |-- queue.add() --> Redis <-- worker.process()
              |                                    |-- download, extract, embed
```

Split the BullMQ worker into a dedicated Cloud Run service. The queue code is already architected for this — `src/queue/workers.ts` can run standalone. This lets you scale API instances and worker instances independently.

### Phase 2: Chat Queue + SSE

```
User → Express API → Push to Queue → Return "accepted" (50ms)
                          ↓
                    Worker → LLM call → DB query → Write result
                          ↓
                    Redis Pub/Sub → SSE push to client
```

Move chat requests through the queue when LLM latency becomes a throughput bottleneck. The heavy logic (`getFormattedAnswerToUserinput`) is already isolated and can be moved into a worker with minimal refactoring.

### Phase 3: Connection Pooling + Read Replicas

At high read volume, the database becomes the bottleneck:
- **PgBouncer** for connection pooling (reduce per-connection overhead)
- **Read replicas** for embedding search queries (separate read/write traffic)
- **Redis caching** for frequently accessed embeddings and user profiles

### Running Tests

```bash
# Seed test data (required once)
npm run test:seed

# Run retrieval evaluation
npm run test:retrieval
```

### Test Fixtures

Test documents and queries are defined in `src/__tests__/fixtures/testDocuments.ts`. Add new test cases as your corpus grows to catch regressions.

## Agent Tracing

The agent includes an internal tracing system that captures structured spans for each node in the workflow.

### Trace Structure

```typescript
interface AgentTrace {
  traceId: string;
  queryId: string;
  query: string;
  startTime: number;
  spans: TraceSpan[]; // Append-only, each node adds one
  outcome: TraceOutcome; // Set once at the end
}

interface TraceSpan {
  node: string; // 'retrievalGate', 'hybridSearch', etc.
  startTime: number;
  durationMs: number;
  meta: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
}

interface TraceOutcome {
  status: 'success' | 'refused' | 'clarified' | 'error';
  reason?: string;
  triggeringSpan?: string;
  durationMs: number;
}
```

### What Each Node Captures

| Node                        | Metadata                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `retrievalGate`             | queryType, wasRewritten, shouldRetrieveDocuments, shouldRetrieveMemories           |
| `retrieveMemoriesAndChunks` | profileMemories, contextualMemories, chunksRetrieved (+ hybrid search diagnostics) |
| `injectContext`             | documentsUsed, memoriesUsed, contextTokens, responseLength                         |
| `extractAndStoreKnowledge`  | contentType, memoriesAdded, studyMaterialIngested                                  |
| `clarificationResponse`     | responseLength                                                                     |

### Retrieval Diagnostics

The `retrieveMemoriesAndChunks` node captures detailed pipeline diagnostics to pinpoint where retrieval quality degrades:

| Stage             | Metrics                                                                                           | What it tells you                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hybrid Search** | `embeddingCandidates`, `keywordCandidates`, `fusionOverlap`, `fusedCount`, `topEmbeddingDistance` | How many chunks each search found, overlap between them |
| **Pipeline**      | `afterRelevanceFilter`, `afterDedup`, `afterBudget`                                               | Chunk counts after each filtering stage                 |
| **Quality**       | `topChunkDistance`, `scoreSpread`, `uniqueDocuments`                                              | Confidence signals for retrieval quality                |
| **Temporal**      | `temporalFilterApplied`, `queryYear`                                                              | Whether date filtering was used                         |

embeddingCandidates: 40  →  keywordCandidates: 12  →  fusedCount: 35
    ↓
afterRelevanceFilter: 28  →  afterDedup: 22  →  afterBudget: 8
```

**Interpreting the diagnostics:**

- High `embeddingCandidates` but low `afterRelevanceFilter` → relevance rules too strict
- High `afterDedup` but low `afterBudget` → budget constraints cutting relevant chunks
- Large `scoreSpread` → retrieved chunks have varying quality
- `fusionOverlap` near 0 → embedding and keyword searches found different results (query ambiguity)

### Design Principles

- **Append-only spans**: Each node pushes its span, never mutates previous spans
- **Single outcome**: Set once at the end of the workflow
- **Stored in session state**: Flows through AgentState → Redis, expires with session
- **LangSmith compatible**: Trace data can be attached to LangSmith span metadata

### Trace Pruning

Traces are for observability, not a secondary memory system. Automatic pruning prevents bloat:

| Limit                          | Value     | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `MAX_RUNS_PER_SESSION`         | 50        | Cap trace history per session  |
| `MAX_SPANS_PER_RUN`            | 100       | Limit events per trace         |
| `MAX_CANDIDATES_PER_RETRIEVAL` | 10        | Limit logged chunk candidates  |
| `MAX_BYTES_PER_RUN`            | 100 KB    | Hard cap on trace size         |
| `MAX_SNIPPET_LENGTH`           | 100 chars | Truncate content in candidates |
| `MAX_QUERY_LENGTH`             | 500 chars | Truncate long queries          |

**When pruning happens:**

Pruning occurs at the **end of the workflow** in terminal nodes (`extractAndStoreKnowledge` and `clarificationResponse`), after the outcome is set but before the trace is returned. This ensures the complete trace is captured before pruning.

**What gets pruned:**

- Raw chunk content → replaced with short snippets
- Full embeddings → dropped entirely
- Large metadata values → truncated to 200 chars
- Old spans → only most recent N kept

**Candidate summaries:**

Instead of storing full chunk data, traces store lightweight summaries:

```typescript
type CandidateSummary = {
  id: string;
  documentId: string;
  score: number; // distance or confidence
  snippet: string; // first 100 chars
};
```

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { TraceUtil, TRACE_LIMITS } from './util/TraceUtil';

// Create pruned candidate summaries
const summaries = TraceUtil.createCandidateSummaries(chunks);

// Prune a trace before storage
const prunedTrace = TraceUtil.pruneTrace(trace);

// Prune session trace history
const prunedHistory = TraceUtil.pruneSessionTraces(traces);
```

### LangSmith Integration

LangGraph automatically traces all workflow runs to LangSmith when configured.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Add to .env.local
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=ls__...
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=study-agent
```

**Custom Metadata:**

The trace utilities convert our domain-specific trace data to LangSmith-compatible metadata:

```typescript
import { LangSmithUtil } from './util/LangSmithUtil';

// Convert trace to LangSmith metadata
const metadata = LangSmithUtil.traceToMetadata(trace);
// {
//   'agent.traceId': '...',
//   'agent.outcome': 'success',
//   'agent.queryType': 'study_content',
//   'retrieval.embeddingCandidates': 40,
//   'retrieval.afterBudget': 8,
//   ...
// }

// Get a one-line summary for logging
const summary = LangSmithUtil.traceSummaryLine(trace);
// "[success] | 1234ms | type=study_content | chunks=8 | memories=2 | dist=0.234"

// Detect quality issues for alerting
const issues = LangSmithUtil.detectQualityIssues(trace);
// ['weak_top_match', 'slow_execution']
```

**Viewing in LangSmith:**

1. Go to your LangSmith project
2. Filter runs by custom metadata (e.g., `agent.outcome = error`)
3. Set up alerts for quality issues
4. Build dashboards tracking `retrieval.*` metrics

### Trace API Endpoint

The server exposes trace data via API:

```bash
# Get latest trace
curl http://localhost:3000/api/trace

# Include trace in chat response
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is in my notes?", "includeTrace": true}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "trace": {
    "traceId": "abc-123",
    "outcome": { "status": "success", "durationMs": 1234 },
    "spans": [...]
  },
  "metrics": { "agent.queryType": "study_content", ... },
  "issues": [],
  "summary": "[success] | 1234ms | type=study_content | chunks=8"
}
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit           # Fast unit tests (~200ms)
npm run test:smoke          # End-to-end smoke tests (~20s)
npm run test:retrieval      # Retrieval quality metrics (~2s)
npm run test:integration    # Comprehensive pipeline tests (~2min)

# Setup
npm run test:seed           # Seed test data (run once before retrieval tests)

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### Smoke Tests

Minimal end-to-end tests to verify the agent pipeline is wired correctly.

| Test           | Path                                 | Verifies                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Happy path     | Gate → Retrieval → Context → Extract | Full pipeline executes, success outcome         |
| Alternate path | Gate → Context (skip retrieval)      | Conversational queries skip retrieval correctly |

These are NOT quality evaluations — they just verify the pipeline doesn't break.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests run fast (~200ms) with no external dependencies. All external services are mocked.

**`documentUtil.test.ts`** - 28 tests covering:

| Function                | Tests                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `applyBudget`           | `maxChunks`, `maxPerDoc`, `maxContextTokens`, `maxChunkTokens`, combined constraints, empty input    |
| `estimateTokens`        | ~4 chars/token heuristic, empty string, rounding, whitespace handling                                |
| `cosineSimilarity`      | Identical vectors (1.0), orthogonal (0.0), opposite (-1.0), symmetry, high-dimensional, zero vectors |
| `removeDuplicateChunks` | High similarity removal, threshold behavior, missing embeddings                                      |

**`safeFetchJson.test.ts`** - 6 tests covering:

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| OK response + valid JSON | Returns parsed data |
| OK response + HTML body | Throws "Unexpected response from server" |
| `response.redirected = true` | Throws "Session expired" |
| URL without `/api/` | Throws "Session expired" |
| Error (500) + JSON body | Returns parsed error JSON |
| Error (502) + HTML body | Throws "Server error (502)" |

**`ingestBatching.test.ts`** - 5 tests covering:

| Scenario | Assertion |
|----------|-----------|
| 10 chunks (batch size 64) | 1 `embedBatch` call |
| 200 chunks (batch size 64) | 4 calls with sizes [64, 64, 64, 8] |
| 0 chunks | No `embedBatch` calls, returns chunkCount 0 |
| Embedding mapping | Each chunk gets correct embedding in `upsertChunks` |
| Temporal extraction | `extractTemporalRange` called for every chunk, data flows to DB |

**`embedBatch.test.ts`** - 5 tests covering:

| Scenario | Assertion |
|----------|-----------|
| Empty input | Returns `[]`, no API call |
| Single text | Calls API with `['text']`, returns 1 embedding |
| Multiple texts | Returns correct count, passes full array to API |
| Mismatched response count | Throws "expected N results, got M" |
| Retry config | `withRetry` called with `maxAttempts: 5, baseDelayMs: 2000` |

### Integration Tests

Integration tests run the full agent pipeline and assert on trace outcomes. These tests hit real APIs (Anthropic, VoyageAI) and require environment variables.

**What the tests verify:**

| Test Category      | Assertions                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trace Outcomes     | `success` for valid queries, `clarified` for ambiguous ones |
| Retrieval Pipeline | Documents retrieved when expected, diagnostics captured     |
| Temporal Filtering | `queryYear` extracted and applied correctly                 |
| Performance        | Total duration < 30s, no span > 15s                         |
| Error Resilience   | Minimal/long queries handled gracefully                     |

**Example test:**

```typescript
it('should retrieve documents for study content queries', async () => {
  const { trace } = await runAgent('What does my resume say?');

  const gateSpan = trace?.spans.find((s) => s.node === 'retrievalGate');
  expect(gateSpan?.meta.shouldRetrieveDocuments).toBe(true);

  const retrievalSpan = trace?.spans.find((s) => s.node === 'retrieveMemoriesAndChunks');
  expect(retrievalSpan?.meta.embeddingCandidates).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

**Test Configuration:**

Tests use a 60-second timeout (configured in `vitest.config.ts`) to accommodate API latency. Environment variables are loaded via `src/__tests__/setup.ts`.

## Evaluation Suite

The evaluation suite tests end-to-end agent behavior with structured assertions. Unlike unit tests, these run the full agent pipeline and evaluate response quality.

### Running Evaluations

```bash
# 1. Seed test fixtures (required once, or after changing fixtures)
npx tsx src/evals/seed.ts

# 2. Run local evaluations
npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts

# Run with verbose output
npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts --verbose

# Run specific category
npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts --category off_topic

# 3. Run with LangSmith tracking (requires LANGCHAIN_API_KEY)
npx tsx src/evals/runExperiment.ts
```

### Test Categories

| Category               | Expected Behavior | What it tests                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `study_content`        | ANSWER            | Questions about documents/notes               |
| `personal`             | ANSWER            | User-specific info (goals, history)           |
| `temporal_containment` | ANSWER            | Time-bound queries ("What did I do in 2023?") |
| `off_topic`            | REFUSE            | Lifestyle/opinion questions (stocks, fashion) |
| `unclear`              | CLARIFY           | Vague/ambiguous queries                       |

### Evaluators

Each evaluator returns a score (0-1), weight, and critical flag:

| Evaluator      | Weight | Critical | What it checks                            |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `behavior`     | 3.0    | Yes      | ANSWER/REFUSE/CLARIFY matches expected    |
| `routing`      | 2.0    | No       | Gate classified query correctly           |
| `retrieval`    | 1.0    | No       | Retrieved when expected, skipped when not |
| `budget`       | 1.0    | No       | Latency and token usage within thresholds |
| `contains_any` | 1.5    | No       | Response contains expected keywords       |
| `must_cover`   | 1.5    | No       | Response covers expected topics           |
| `amount`       | 2.0    | No       | Numeric values match expected             |

**Scoring:**

- Critical evaluators must pass (score = 1.0) or entire test fails
- Non-critical evaluators contribute to weighted average
- Pass threshold: weighted score ≥ 70%

### Behavior Detection

The evaluator uses **trace-first** detection with text fallback:

1. Check gate `queryType` from trace (most reliable)
   - `off_topic` → REFUSE
   - `needsClarification` → CLARIFY
2. Fall back to response text pattern matching
   - Refusal patterns: "I'm a study assistant", "outside my expertise", etc.
   - Clarification patterns: "could you clarify", "what are you referring to", etc.

### Test Fixtures

Test documents are defined in `src/evals/fixtures/evalDocuments.ts` with fake data:

| Document       | Content                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| User Profile   | Fake career info, severance ($42,500), work history |
| Lost in Middle | Summary of position effects in LLM context          |
| ReAct Paper    | Reasoning + acting framework explanation            |
| React Docs     | JavaScript library overview                         |
| Hair Loss      | Finasteride vs dutasteride comparison               |

The seed script ingests these under a dedicated `EVAL_USER_ID` so tests run against consistent data regardless of your personal documents.

### Adding New Test Cases

1. Add the test case to `src/evals/dataset.ts`:

```typescript
{
  userQuery: 'What is transformer architecture?',
  category: 'study_content',
  expected_behavior: 'ANSWER',
  answer_must_contain_any: ['attention', 'encoder', 'decoder'],
  dataset_split: ['base'],
}
```

2. Add corresponding fixture document to `src/evals/fixtures/evalDocuments.ts` if needed

3. Re-run seed: `npx tsx src/evals/seed.ts`

4. Run evals: `npx tsx src/evals/runLocal.ts`
